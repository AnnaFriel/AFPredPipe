# AFPredPipe
Peptide-based Vaccine Prediction Pipeline Applied to Protoparvoviruses
This is an immuno-informatics pipeline for predicting peptide-based vaccine candidates. It was developed and deployed for the prediction of peptide-based vaccine candidates for the protoparvoviruses Bufavirus-1VP2, Tusavirus-VP2 and Cutavirus.
All the in-house scripts used in this pipeline are present in the Scripts folder. The folder contains codes for:
  Sequence Alignment using python
  Filtering using python
This pipeline was inspired by: Shukla P, Pandey P, Prasad B, Robinson T, Purohit R, D'Cruz LG, Tambuwala MM, Mutreja A, Harkin J, Rai TS, Murray EK, Gibson DS, Bjourson AJ. Immuno-informatics analysis predicts B and T cell consensus epitopes for designing peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 with 99.82% global population coverage.
